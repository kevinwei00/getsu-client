## Purpose

I have downloaded and used countless shopping list, pantry organizer, fridge helper, and related apps but could never find one that quite clicked. They either suffered from unintuitive UI/UX, or even worse, they were bloated with excess features that over-complicate the already stressful task of managing the items in your house. 

I just wanted something simple and elegant that showed me how much of something is left and when it was going to expire, *at a glance*.

The core philosophy that I stuck to when designing the user-facing view of Getsu was to show only as much as needed, and nothing more.
